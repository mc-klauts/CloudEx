# CloudEx
CloudEx is an Minecraft-Server-System that can handle proxies and gameservers at one time.
It can handle more than one Minecraft- or BungeeCord Server, by creating groups of servers.
It also comes with some nice features, like an in-built SignSystem or even a Webinterface 
to control your Cloud.
The CloudEx has a AddonSystem, that means you can develope an Module with the CloudModule-API
and load it into your Cloud!
The Cloud also is smart, for example if your LobbyServer is almost full of players,
the cloud automaticly creates a new LobbyServer for more players.

The CloudEx-Team gives you a daily Cloud-Support. If you need help with your Cloud 
or the developing of Cloud-Modules and Cloud-PlugIns we can give Support to you on Discord!

The Cloud-API also can help you with handleing all your Plug-Ins and Players,
